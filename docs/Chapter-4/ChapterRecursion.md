Recursion is the concept where an object (such as a function, 
a set, or an algorithm) is defined in the following way: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item There are one or more base cases. 
\item There are one or more rules that define an object in terms of 
      ``smaller'' objects that have already been defined. 
\end{itemize} 
In this chapter, we will see several examples of such recursive 
definitions and how to use them to solve counting problems.
