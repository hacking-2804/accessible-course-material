We all have some intuitive understanding of the notions of ``chance'' 
and ``probability''. When buying a lottery ticket, we know that there is 
a chance of winning the jackpot, but we also know that this chance 
is very small. Before leaving home in the morning, we check the weather 
forecast and see that, with probability $80\%$, we get $15$ centimetres 
of snow in Ottawa. In this chapter, we will give a formal definition 
of this notion of ``probability''. We start by presenting a surprising 
application of probability and random numbers.
