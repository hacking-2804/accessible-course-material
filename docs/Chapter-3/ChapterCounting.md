Given a set of $23$ elements, how many subsets of size $17$ are there? 
How many solutions are there to the equation
\[ x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{12} = 873 ,
\]
where $x_1 \geq 0$, $x_2 \geq 0$, \ldots, $x_{12} \geq 0$ are 
integers? In this chapter, we will introduce some general techniques 
that can be used to answer questions of these types.
